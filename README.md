# CSE489: Introduction to Machine Learning-Project
- exploits.go - used to scrape exploit-db.com: grabs the description and code for each entry
- exploits2.txt - contains entries from exploit-db.com
- label_exploits.ipynb 
  - uses BOW model over text entries
  - uses a keyword search to label some of the text entries with specific kinds of exploits (privilege escalation exploits, race condition exploits, memory safety exploits, and input validation exploits)
  - all keywords used to label are removed from the feature set
  - Naive Bayes and Random Forest are used to predict labels, utilizing labeled dataset
 - bagofofwords.txt - contains the words in the feature set with the number of times they appear
